# Disjoint sets continued



When a node has a NULL link, we call it the "root" of a set. If you call Find() on a node with a NULL link, it will return the node's item number, and that is the set id of the node. Therefore, when you first start, every node is the root of its own set, and when you call Find(i), it will return i.

When you call Union(i, j), remember that i and j must be set id's. Therefore, they must be nodes with NULL links. What you do is have one of those nodes set its link to the other node.


Union is pretty simple, too, but you have some choices about how to determine which node sets its link field to the other. We use three methods to do this:

- Union by size: Make the node whose set size is smaller point to the node whose set size is bigger. Break ties arbitrarily.

- Union by height: The height of a set is the longest number of links that it takes to get from one of its items to the root. With union by height, you make the node whose height is smaller point to the node whose height is bigger.

- Union by rank with path compression: This works exactly like union by height, except you don't really know the height of the set. Instead, you use the set's rank, which is what its height would be, were you using union by height. The reason that you don't know the height is that when you call Find(i) on an element, you perform "path compression." What this does is set the link of all non-root nodes from the path from i to the root, to the root.

# Running Times

We assume the number of items in the instance of disjoint sets is n:
- Initializing an instance of disjoint sets: O(n)
- Performing Union() in any of the implementations, size height or Rank with path compression: O(1)

- Performing Find() in Union by size or height: O(log(n)) 
N is number of elements
- Performing Find() in Union by rank with path compression: O(α(n)), where α(n) is the inverse of Ackerman's function. While you cannot say that Find() is constant time, for all practical purposes, it is.
