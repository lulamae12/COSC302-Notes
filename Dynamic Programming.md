# Dynamic Programming
http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/DynamicProgramming/

Dynamic Programming is a technique that is used to optimize the running time and effenciy of a program, often using recursion

# How it works (baisclly)

Dynamic programming is pretty straight forward:
1. Find the recursive solution to your problem
2. Cache the answers to recursive calls so that they can be returned instanly when they are repeated. This is called **Memoization**
3. OPTIONAL: Try and eliminate recursive calls
4. OPTIONAL: Clear the cache
