# Topological Sort
http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Topological/

Topological sorts work on directed, acyclic graphs, and they are very simple. It is a sorting of the vertices of a graph, such that if there is an edge from a to b, then a comes before b in the sorting. 

# Uses of Topological Sorts

- Scheduling  (preventing course conflicts, railway collsisons)
- Shortest Path from a source to a node (sometimes better than Dijkstras Algo, sometimes not)
- Find the number of paths from a source to a node
- Find the maximum flow
